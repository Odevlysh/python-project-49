# Brain Games

## Description

This project is a collection of five console games designed for educational and entertainment purposes. Each game tests the user's knowledge and problem-solving skills in different areas of mathematics. The games included are:

1. **Even Number Check**: Determine if a given number is even. (Command: `brain-even`)
2. **Calculator**: Sum two given numbers. (Command: `brain-calc`)
3. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Find the greatest common divisor of two given numbers. (Command: `brain-gcd`)
4. **Arithmetic Progression**: Identify the missing number in a given arithmetic progression. (Command: `brain-progression`)
5. **Prime Number Check**: Determine if a given number is prime. (Command: `brain-prime`)

Each game provides a fun and interactive way to practice and enhance mathematical skills. The objective of each game is to answer three questions correctly in a row to win. If a player gives an incorrect answer, the game stops.

## Minimum Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.11 or higher
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **pip**: The package installer for Python (comes with Python 3.4 and later)

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system before proceeding with the installation and running the project.

## Installation

### Using pip (Recommended for End Users)

1. **Clone the repository**:
    Open your terminal and run the following commands:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Odevlysh/python-project-49.git
    cd python-project-49
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages. Run the following commands:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies using `pip`**:
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```

## Running the Games

After installing the dependencies, you can run any of the games using the following commands:

- To check if a number is even:
    ```sh
    brain-even
    ```
- To sum two numbers:
    ```sh
    brain-calc
    ```
- To find the greatest common divisor:
    ```sh
    brain-gcd
    ```
- To find the missing number in an arithmetic progression:
    ```sh
    brain-progression
    ```
- To check if a number is prime:
    ```sh
    brain-prime
    ```
